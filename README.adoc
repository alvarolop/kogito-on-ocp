= Kogito on OCP

This repository is a starting point for developers who want to start with Kogito on OCP 4.


== What is Kogito

Kogito is a cloud-native business automation technology for building cloud-ready business applications. Kogito is designed specifically to excel in a hybrid cloud environment and to be adaptable to your domain and tooling needs. The core objective of Kogito is to help you mold a set of business processes and decisions into your own domain-specific cloud-native set of services [1].

== Deploying Kogito services on OpenShift

To help you deploy your services on OpenShift, Kogito provides an operator and a command-line interface (CLI):


*Kogito Operator*: An operator that guides you through the deployment process. [1]
*Kogito command-line interface (CLI)*: A CLI tool that enables you to interact with the Kogito Operator for deployment tasks. [2]


=== Install Kogito operator

First, look for the Kogito operator on the `Operator Hub`:
